                    <strong>Objective:</strong><br>
                    By the end of this lesson, students will be able to identify the basic parts of a computer, understand their functions, and differentiate between hardware and software.

                <h3>What Makes Up a Computer?</h3>
                <p>
                    A computer consists of two main components: hardware and software. Hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer that you can see and touch, while software includes the programs and applications that make the hardware useful. In this lesson, we will focus on the hardware components of a computer.

                                Input devices enable you to interact with the computer by sending information or commands to it. These devices allow you to provide instructions, type data, or make selections, helping the computer understand what you want it to do.

                                Output devices are parts of the computer that allow you to see or hear the results of the computer's work. When you give a computer instructions (input), it processes them and uses output devices to show you the result. These devices turn digital information into something you can perceive—whether it's text, images, sound, or physical copies.

                                <li>Printer: Produces physical copies of documents or images.</li>
                                <li>Speakers: Output sound from the computer.</li>

                                The system unit is the central part of a computer that houses its main components, including the motherboard, processor (CPU), memory (RAM), storage devices, and power supply. It's the main enclosure that contains all the hardware necessary for the computer to function. While external components such as the monitor, keyboard, and mouse are critical for interaction, the system unit is where most of the computing processes happen.

                                Storage devices are essential components of a computer that are used to store data, files, and programs. They ensure that information is kept secure and readily accessible for future use, whether it's saved on the computer's internal hard drive, an external device, or in the cloud.
